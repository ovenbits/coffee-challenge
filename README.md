# The Oven Bits ☕ Challenge

What kind of hip-software-development-studio would we be if didn't mention our exuberant love of coffee?!

**!! WE LOVE COF-**

Yeah okay, so we like coffee at Oven Bits. Naturally, some of us here are more fussy about it than others, but we do drink a lot of it.

And so, prospective Oven Bits developer, here is the challenge set before you: a chance to demonstrate YOUR love for coffee, and show off your craft along the way.

## Overview

The basic idea is a "coffee logger". This app would let you record how many cups of coffee you have made, and will show you fun information about that data.

## Features

### Logging cups of coffee

- User can log a new entry.
  - input the # of cups in the entry
  - minimum qty of 1 cup
  - maximum qty of 25 cups
  - did the coffee have cream?
  - did the coffee have sugar?
- User can delete an entry.
- User can update an entry, and change any of the information they originally entered.

### Seeing entries

- User can see a list of the entries they've made
  - Sorted chronologically from top to bottom, with the most recent entries at the top, and oldest below.
- User can see the date & time the entry was logged
- User can see # of cups in the entry.
- User can see if the cup contained cream/sugar.

### Statistics

- User can see the total # of cups they've entered all time.
- User can see what percent of cups were "black" vs which contained cream and/or sugar.

### Bonus Ideas

- We often share pots of coffee at Oven Bits, so it might be cool to see the names of people who "participated" in an entry.
- If you can persist the data locally, even better, but not necessary to complete.
- Some of us are more concerned about our overall caffeine intake. It'd be cool to see how many milligrams of caffeine we've consumed total along with the total # of cups.
- It'd be fun if all the entries were grouped by day instead of all lumped together. Extra bonus points if each day has individual stats as well.
- Icons are always a fun way to help break up text data ;)

## FAQ

#### Yeah... I don't like coffee :/

That’s okay! Feel free to substitute the "coffee" part of the challenge with any of your favorite snacks and or drinks. Burgers, soda, chips, tea, you name it! It’s a chance to make it more your own!
